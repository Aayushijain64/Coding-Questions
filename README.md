# Welcome to Important Coding Questions.
This open source community is made to buck up and get ready for all the types of Coding Questions. Here's a collection of quetions that would help every engineering student to get ready for coding questions and interview round.

## Let's Contribute
If you don't have git on your machine, install it.

## Fork this repository
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository
Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```git clone "url you just copied"```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Practical-Files.git```

where Your_Username is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Practical-Files repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```cd Coding-Questions ```

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:
```git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>```

## Add codes, make necessary changes and commit those changes
